A new extension version, "{{ extension.name }}", version {{ version.version }}, was auto-approved.

The diff between this version and the last approved version looks like this:
{% for file in changeset.changed %}
  M {{ file }}
{% endfor %}
{% for file in changeset.added %}
  + {{ file }}
{% endfor %}

(where M means "modified" and "+" means "added")

The full review details can be found at {{ review_url }}, and the extension's version page
can be found at {{ version_url }}.
